# Give-me-a-password

First thing I had to do was define all the characters on the keyboard that 
will allow them to use for a password.

The first function was a getRandom to set special characters to random

then the next function was the actual password generator var password and passwordchar close them with [] to make them into arrays.

made sure alerts popped up to let the user know about the character limits and then made a confirm to each character and symbols to ask if they wanted that 
specific part.

How it looks:
